\title{Find errors in data given a set of validation rules.}
\description{
Find errors in data given a set of validation rules.
The \code{errorlocate} helps to identify obvious errors in raw datasets.
}
\details{
It works in tandem with the package \code{validate}.
With \code{validate} you formulate data validation rules to which the data must comply.
For example:

"age cannot be negative": \code{age >= 0}

While \code{validate} can identify if a record is valid or not, it does not identify
which of the variables are responsible for the invalidation. This may seem a simple task,
but is actually quite tricky:  a set of validation rules form a web
of dependent variables: changing the value of an invalid record to repair for rule 1, may invalidate
the record for rule 2.

Errorlocate provides a small framework for record based error detection and implements the Felligi Holt
algorithm. This algorithm assumes there is no other information available then the values of a record
and a set of validation rules. The algorithm minimizes the (weighted) number of values that need
to be adjusted to remove the invalidation.

The \code{errorlocate} package translates the validation and error localization problem into
a mixed integer problem and uses a mip solver to find a solution.
